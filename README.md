At weekends there are often two events. The owner packs the buns into plastic containers. Each container has the same number of buns. If 288 buns are needed for one event and 660 buns are needed for another, determine the maximum number of buns per container so that a whole number of containers can be taken to each event.

{Use Euclid’s Algorithm for find the HCF}

You must show all the steps taken.
660 = 2(288) + 84
288 = 3(84) + 36
84 = 2(36) + 12
36 = 3(12) + 0

This show that the HCF of 660 and 288 will be 12 since that is the last number before the remainder had reached 0.

You have decided to save some money during the six-week holiday. You save 1p on the first day, 2p on the second day, 3p on the third day and so on. How much will you have at the end of the holiday (42 days)?

The arithmetic sequence formula that needs to be used in order to figure the problem out is shown below.

We then need to substitute the required numbers into the formula in order to determine the results in this it would be:
- n = 42 (due to it being number of terms we need to calculate)
- a = 1(as it is the frist number in the series)

Which means the formula looks like the following:

With this established the calculation can be carried out in order to get the result 903, by then converting into terms of money you would have £9.03 at the end of your holiday.
