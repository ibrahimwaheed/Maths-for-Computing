At weekends there are often two events. The owner packs the buns into plastic containers. Each container has the same number of buns. If 288 buns are needed for one event and 660 buns are needed for another, determine the maximum number of buns per container so that a whole number of containers can be taken to each event.

{Use Euclidâ€™s Algorithm for find the HCF}

You must show all the steps taken.
660 = 2(288) + 84
288 = 3(84) + 36
84 = 2(36) + 12
36 = 3(12) + 0

This show that the HCF of 660 and 288 will be 12 since that is the last number before the remainder had reached 0.
